# lending

A Mobile Lending Application project using Flutter.

Overall Description:

This mobile app allows easy money lending for users as they send loan requests to the owners.
If approved, they will then receive the money through GCash and it will then display on the application how much is loaned.
It will also reflect the payment together with its interests if the loaner will not be able to pay on the succeeding months.
